The \"Failed\" and \"Error\" events indicate that the pod was not able to find or download the specified image.\\Here is a breakdown of the events:\\1. \"Normal Scheduled\": This event indicates that the pod was scheduled successfully on a node.\\2. \"Normal Pulling\": This event indicates that the pod is attempting to pull the container image.\\3. \"Warning Failed\": This event indicates that the pod failed to pull the specified container image. The error message states that the image \"c8n.io/vfarcic/silly-demo:this-tag-does-not-exist\" was not found.\\4. \"Warning Failed\" (repeated): This event indicates that the pod encountered an error while trying to pull the image. The error message states that there was an \"ErrImagePull\".\\5. \"Warning Failed\" (repeated): This event indicates that the pod encountered an \"ImagePullBackOff\" error, indicating that it failed to pull the image.\\6. \"Normal BackOff\": This event indicates that the pod is backing off from attempting to pull the image.\\The \"Failed\" and \"Error\" events suggest that the container image specified in the pod's configuration does not exist or is not accessible. This could happen if the image repository or registry does not contain the specified image or if the credentials to access the image are incorrect.\\To fix the issue, you should verify that the container image exists and is accessible and confirm that the image's reference in the pod configuration is correct."\      },\      "finish_reason": "stop"\    }\  ],\  "usage": {\    "prompt_tokens": 386,\    "completion_tokens": 341,\    "total_tokens": 727\  }\}\
